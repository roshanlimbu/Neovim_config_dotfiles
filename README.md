# Introduction
This repo hosts my Nvim configuration for Windows. init.lua is the config entry point for the whole setup.

My config files are customized for my comfort. If you want to setup your neovim on the fly, you can clone this repo and modify according to your comfort. I recommend you to copy only the part you want and customize the rest yourself as it makes it unique to yourself.
